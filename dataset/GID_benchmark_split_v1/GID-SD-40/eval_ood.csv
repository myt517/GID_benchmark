Hi, i was checking my old statements and found a discrepancy with a large amount transaction. I am sure it was not done by me. Please let me know if i could raise a dispute as its very late.	direct_debit_payment_not_recognised
There is a payment showing that I know I didn't make. I didn't use my card that day and I'm sure of it. Can you please cancel that transaction and return my money? Thankyou	direct_debit_payment_not_recognised
I was checking the app for my account and I noticed there is an authorized charge on it.  I haven't used my card today, so I know I didn't do it.  I would like the transaction reversed and the money replaced.	direct_debit_payment_not_recognised
There is a direct debit transaction that I did not authorize	direct_debit_payment_not_recognised
I'm checking my statements and I saw a purchase from a couple weeks ago that I don't recall at all. Not only that, but I don't even know the business that charged it. I'm not sure if I did it or not, but can we check it and see if we can trace it back to make certain?	direct_debit_payment_not_recognised
